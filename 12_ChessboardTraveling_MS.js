/* function ChessboardTraveling(str) read str which will be a string consisting of the location of a space on a standard 8x8 chess board with no pieces on the board along with another space on the chess board. The structure of str will be the following: "(x y)(a b)" where (x y) represents the position you are currently on with x and y ranging from 1 to 8 and (a b) represents some other space on the chess board with a and b also ranging from 1 to 8 where a > x and b > y. Your program should determine how many ways there are of traveling from (x y) on the board to (a b) moving only up and to the right. For example: if str is (1 1)(2 2) then your program should output 2 because there are only two possible ways to travel from space (1 1) on a chessboard to space (2 2) while making only moves up and to the right. */

/* Detailed Explaination of the Math involved: If you move the (𝑎,𝑏) to (𝑐,𝑑) where 𝑐≥𝑎 and 𝑑≥𝑏.

In total, we know that you have to take (𝑐−𝑎)+(𝑑−𝑏) steps of which (𝑐−𝑎) of them are horizontal steps and clearly the rest are vertical moves.

That is out of (𝑐−𝑎)+(𝑑−𝑏) steps, we have to select 𝑐−𝑎 of them to be horizontal steps. Hence the number of possible moves are

(((𝑐−𝑎)+(𝑑−𝑏))/𝑐−𝑎)=(𝑐−𝑎+𝑑−𝑏)!/(𝑐−𝑎)!(𝑑−𝑏)! */
